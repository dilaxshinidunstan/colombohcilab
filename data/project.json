      "description": "This research explores how Adaptive User Interfaces (AUIs) can be improved by integrating real-time cognitive load assessment to optimize user experience, reduce mental effort, and boost interaction quality. It focuses on detecting users' mental workload and dynamically adjusting interface elements-like layout and navigation-non-intrusively, making systems more intuitive and user-centered.",

      "description": "This study tested ten warning label designs for AI-generated content on social media and found that while labels increased belief that content was AI-made, only certain designs were trustedâ€”yet none significantly changed user engagement like likes or shares. Differences in engagement were more influenced by content type, such as political versus entertainment.",
